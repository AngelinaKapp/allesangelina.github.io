   Who am I? Who am I? <br>
   I am <i id="line-through"> Jean Valjean!</i> <b><i> Angelina Kapp! </b></i>
   <br><br>
   Willkommen in meine Webseite! <br>
   -Welcome to my website! <br>
   I am a high school student from a
   suburb of Chicago who will be living in Germany for a cultural exchange during the 2015- 2016 calender year!
   How you might ask? I am a recipient of the <a href="http://www.usagermanyscholarship.org/" class="active2">
  CBYX</a>-<a href="http://yfuusa.org/study-abroad.php" class="active2"> YFU </a> scholarship.
  I am honored to be selected amoung the thousands of amazing applicants.
  All of which were brave enough to push them selves to new limits.
  <br> <br>
  As I go through this amazing journey I will be documenting my expirences on my blog. I have a
  passion for computer science and have programmed this site "from scratch". As I grow throughout this year
  I hope my knowledge of computer science will also grow with me.
  If you have any questions and would like to contact me, I can be reached by my
  <a href="mailto:angelinakapp@comcast.net?Subject=Hi%20Angelina!" target="_top" class="active2">email</a>.
  <br> <br>
  Are you interested in reading other CBYX blogs? If so click on my friends' names to read about their
  German journeys!
  <br><br>
  Lastly but certianly not least, thank you to my amazing cousin who answers my computer science questions no matter how
  silly or simple they are. I love you <a href="http://cassidoo.co" class="active2">Cassidy</a>.
