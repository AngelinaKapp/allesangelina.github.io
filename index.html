<!-- The creator of this document is: Angelina Kapp
She began her construction offically on 6/15/15 and of course
was listening to "Les Miserables" sound track as well ;) -->

<!-- As a warning my commentary will be forever included in my documents.
For an exmaple I am thinking to myself what a wonderful world! And I'd like to
wake up were the clouds are blue and something along the lines as gum drops...-->
