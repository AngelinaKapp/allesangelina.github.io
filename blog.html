     <p id="opening"><b>Hello and welcome to my blog!</b> <br>
     I will be living in Germany, thank you to
     the Congress- Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX) program! During which will be
    a cultural and educational exchange, I could not be more excited!
    My goal is to power global relationships in my native and host country.

    Last weekend I traveled to Washington D.C. for the first time ever. It was so beautiful
    in our nation's capital, I could not believe it! I attended the National Pre
    Departure Orientation, YFU held for the outbound exchange students going to a multitude of countries.
    Youth For Understanding is such an amazing organization, and their event was extremely helpful.
    YFU has a strong volunteer network and many of those who helped at the event were alumni or have travel
    expirence. Everyone I met was so kind and was there to help in preparing for our exchange.

   I was able to meet with some CBYX recipents, other Germany bound students, and made friends
   with people traveling to countries I had not even considered. There were nine CBYX students who were
   able to attend and we had the chance to meet with a staff member of our state senator! Which was quite amazing.
   CBYX-ers also met with the German embassy in D.C. that may have been the coolest part. My oppinion might have
   been swayed in their favor after we recieved German Embassy post-its, but who can be sure right?

   Now I have ten days left in America and feel prepared to go abroad. Unfortunately feeling prepared hasn't
   finished my packing...
